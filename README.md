# How to use the Todo List App:

- Typing into the top input and hitting the Enter/return key adds a todo and empties the input.

- Clicking on the circle at the beginning of a todo toggles whether that todo is completed or not.

- Clicking the "X" on the right side of a Todo removes it from the list.

- Clicking the button 'Clear Completed' will delete all todos that are marked as complete.

- User can click on the All, Active, and Completed links in the footer to see filtered views of the todos.

- The "Items left" counter in the footer properly shows the number of incomplete todos.
